                        ## Development practices in Spartacus
                        ---
                        ## Current practices
                        - Standup
                        - Plannings
                        - Sprint reviews
                        - Sprint retrospectives
                        - Scrum, Agile, XP
                        - Other practices?
                        ---
                        ## Team
                        - Teams
                        - Homogeneus team
                        - Self organizing teams
                        ---
                        ## Priorities
                        - How do we prioritize work?
                        - Ask yourself:
                            - What are our immediate goals?
                            - What are our priorities?
                            - Is this the most important thing I should be working on?
                            - Is this something I have to do now? Can it wait?
                        - Broken builds
                        - Kanban === Queue. But sometimes we skip it.
                        ---
                       ## JIRA
                        - Everything should have a ticket
                        - Granularity (small tasks)
                        - Acceptance criteria
                        - Test scenarios
                        - Boards should be curated daily
                        ---
                        ## Other goals
                        - Priorities. 60% from the PO, 40% from Engineering
                        - Predictable releases. We are not able to release on time, blockers come up, etc.
                        - Better information broadcast
                        - Mixed messages in status call
                        - Clear objectives
                        - Collective ownership
                        - Get rid of the old ways(?)
