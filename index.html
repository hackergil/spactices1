                        ## Development practices in Spartacus
                        ---
                        ## What do we do?
                        - "Standup"
                        - "Sprint reviews"
                        - "Sprint retrospectives"
                        - "Plannings"
                        - Scrum? Agile? XP? Others?

                        A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).

                        ## Priorities
                        - How do we prioritize work?
                        - Ask yourself: What's the most important thing? What are our priorities?
                        - Is this something I have to do now? Can it wait?
                        - Short term goals
                        - Broken builds
                        - Queue. But sometimes we skip it.
                        ---
                        ## Team
                        - We are not a homogeneus team
                        - Teams
                        - Self organizing teams
                        ---
                        ## JIRA tickets and priorities
                        - Everything should have a ticket
                        - Granularity (small tasks)
                        - Acceptance criteria
                        - Test scenarios
                        - Boards should be curated daily
                        ---
                        ## Extras
                        - Priorities. 60% from the PO, 40% from Engineering
                        - Modernization and predictable releases. We are not able to release on time, blockers come up, etc.
                        - Broadcast information better
                        - Mixed messages in status call
                        - e.g. strict compilation
                        - Process
                        - clear objectives for the team, make it cross functional
                        - Get rid of the old ways
